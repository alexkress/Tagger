Tagger is a project developed during Montreal Random Hacks of Kindness

The purpose is to be able to construct a corpora for an underdeveloped or rare languages.
The program uses two lists sentenceList.txt and workerList.txt
sentenceList.txt contains a list of sentences to tag
workerList.txt contains a list of people and phone numbers that participate in the project

The algorithm works as follows:
One sentence is sent out to every person on the list
When a response comes back from a person, it is recorded and the next sentence is sent out to this person

Configuration:
The system currently uses https://www.twilio.com to sent sms. To use you need to create an account and
then fill account and token fields in sms.py. If you are registered for a free account every number entered in workerList.txt
needs to be first authorized by twilio

Usage:
start the program by running 'python MicroTaskManager.py -s "Yes"' the parameter is used to indicate whether
the system will be sending out sms, without the parameter the system will ran in "test" mode where
it will be able to receive responses and simulate sending

Other files:
used_messages.saved.db contains a list of sms already read by the application
responseList.txt collect the responses received by the application, can be used to construct the corpora
